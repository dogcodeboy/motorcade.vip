## What Motorcade Provides
### Armed Protective Services
Licensed armed protection for commercial sites, events, and high-risk environments — delivered with clear protocols and disciplined professionalism.

### Executive Protection
Discreet protection for executives, dignitaries, and high‑net‑worth individuals. Planning first. Presence second. Always confidential.

### Security Assessments & Consulting
When the environment changes, security needs to be reassessed. We evaluate risk factors and produce a written plan you can act on.

## How We Work (Assessment‑Led)
1. **Confidential intake** — we collect only what is needed to understand the environment.
2. **Threat & environment assessment** — location, access control, patterns, and risk indicators.
3. **Deployment plan** — staffing recommendation, shift structure, and escalation protocols.
4. **Contract + execution** — clear terms, clear reporting, and professional delivery.
