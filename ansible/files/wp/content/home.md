    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <ol class="mc-steps">
      <li><strong>Confidential intake</strong> — we collect only what’s needed to understand the environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Threat &amp; environment assessment</strong> — location, access control, patterns, and risk indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment plan</strong> — staffing recommendations, shift structure, and escalation protocols.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution &amp; reporting</strong> — clear terms, clear reporting, professional delivery.</li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Need coverage in Texas?</h3>
