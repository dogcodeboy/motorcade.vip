<!-- Motorcade Playbook 20 — Security Assessment (Placeholder page) -->
# Request a Security Assessment
Security starts with assessment. We evaluate the environment, risk indicators, and operational constraints to produce a plan you can act on.

This page is intentionally simple for now. In the next step, we can add:
- Intake form (short)
- Scheduling / request‑to‑book flow
- Service area gating

---

## What We Evaluate
- Site access and perimeter conditions
- Operational hours and traffic patterns
- Incident history and threat indicators
- Staffing requirements and escalation protocols

---

## Next Step
