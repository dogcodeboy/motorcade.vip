Motorcade Logo Fix Patch (2026-01-15)

What this patch does:
- Replaces the incorrect 'motorcade-logo.png' (which was a UI mockup screenshot) with a clean transparent header lockup.
- Adds a separate square icon asset: ansible/files/wp/assets/images/motorcade/branding/motorcade-icon.png
- Updates Playbook 29 CSS so the header uses ONLY the lockup (hides the redundant site-name text) and increases logo height.

How to apply:
1) Unzip into repo root (motorcade.vip/) and overwrite when prompted.
2) Commit with message: "Fix header logo asset + Playbook 29 CSS"
3) Re-run Playbook 29 on prod (no wildcards):
   cd ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts.ini playbooks/29_brand_logo.yml

Notes:
- No wp-admin uploads, no manual edits required.
- If WP custom logo cache persists, hard refresh browser or purge any caching plugin/CDN.
