# Current State (expected visuals)

## Homepage
- Header and menu render normally (no oversized icons).
- "Built for real-world risk" section has readable text (heading, card titles, card body copy, and links).
- Footer includes the Texas DPS Private Security License line.

## Remaining issue
- The header logo/brand mark is still not showing in the top navigation area.
