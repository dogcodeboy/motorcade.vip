# Motorcade Session Handoff — 2026-01-15

This checkpoint formally ends the 2026-01-15 session to prevent instability from session overload.

## Key Rules Reconfirmed
- Only **one new playbook per session**
- Previous playbooks may be reused or modified
- New playbook work requires a fresh session + checkpoint

## Authoritative References
- motorcade-chatGPT-Session.txt (project root)
- Previous checkpoint: docs/checkpoints/2026-01-14-session-handoff.md

## Important Clarification
A Playbook 31 draft was discussed but **not downloaded, not extracted, and must be ignored**.
Playbook 31 will be rebuilt from scratch next session using this checkpoint + visuals.

## Current Valid State
- Shield-only logo is correct
- Favicon/site icon is correct and locked
- Branding assets cleaned of unreadable wordmark/combo artifacts
- Header layout issues remain intentionally unresolved

## Next Session Start Point
Begin **Playbook 31 only**:
Header layout consolidation, spacing, responsiveness, and branding hierarchy.
