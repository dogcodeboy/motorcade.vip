# Known Issues — 2026-01-15

## 1) Branding quality & header fit

- Logo + wordmark assets still need:
  - transparent backgrounds
  - improved optical sizing
  - clean badge + wordmark variants

## 2) Homepage looks heavy

- Hero area is dark and visually dominant.
- Layout feels slightly crowded.

Goal: **calm authority + clarity**, with **more white space**, not intimidation.

## 3) Theme vendoring path confusion

Theme directory exists under:

- `ansible/files/themes/motorcade-trust/`

This should be normalized to a single canonical path.
