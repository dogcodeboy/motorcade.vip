# Next Session Plan

## Stop condition reached

- Header logo regression resolved
- Server-side backup created
- Repo updated with playbook + docs + checkpoint

## Next work (small scope)

1. Run a quick visual pass on the homepage header across breakpoints
2. If any future image/styling playbook touches `style.css`, ensure it does **not** delete/override the “MC PATCH 37C” block
3. Continue with the planned homepage polish sequence (one playbook per session rule)
