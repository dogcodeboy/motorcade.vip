# Workflow Preferences (Carry Forward)

- **Ansible-only** for theme/assets changes (no wp-admin manual edits)
- Handoffs must include:
  - new checkpoint folder with multiple docs (like 2026-01-15 format)
  - updated root `README.md` with clickable links
  - downloadable zip (not mounted)
- One new playbook per session unless multiple are required to run together
