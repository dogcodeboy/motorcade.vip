SESSION HANDOFF (paste into new ChatGPT session)

Project: motorcade.vip (AWS AL2023 + WordPress + Ansible)

Current state (2026-01-17):
- Header logo regression resolved using Playbook 37c.
- Defensive CSS appended to theme style.css to prevent future hiding/collapse.
- Server-side theme backup created:
  /home/ec2-user/backups/motorcade/motorcade-trust-20260117T041539.tar.gz

Repo updates included in this handoff zip:
- ansible/playbooks/37c_header_logo_absolute_fix.yml
- docs/playbooks/37c-header-logo-absolute-fix.md
- docs/checkpoints/2026-01-17/*
- README.md updated with clickable links

Next steps (one playbook per session rule):
1) Quick responsive header sanity check across breakpoints.
2) Continue homepage polish sequence; ensure future styling playbooks do not remove the “MC PATCH 37C” block in style.css.
