# Verification Steps

After applying Playbook 37c:

1. Hard refresh the site: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
2. Confirm **header logo is visible** and not duplicated
3. Confirm **no Site Identity bar** appears
4. Confirm menu remains in the expected row and does not wrap unexpectedly
5. If you change theme CSS later, re-check that the “MC PATCH 37C” block remains at the end of `style.css`
