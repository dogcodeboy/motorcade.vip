## 📌 Project Checkpoints (Authoritative State Tracking)

This repository uses **formal checkpoints** to preserve working state, prevent regressions,
and allow safe session handoffs when changes become complex (themes, Ansible, infrastructure).

⚠️ **Always read the latest checkpoint before making changes.**

### ✅ Latest Checkpoint (ACTIVE)
## Latest checkpoint

- **2026-01-17** — Header logo regression hard-fixed (Playbook 37c) and server-side theme backup created.
  - Checkpoint: [docs/checkpoints/2026-01-17/README.md](docs/checkpoints/2026-01-17/README.md)
  - Playbook: [ansible/playbooks/37c_header_logo_absolute_fix.yml](ansible/playbooks/37c_header_logo_absolute_fix.yml)
  - Playbook docs: [docs/playbooks/37c-header-logo-absolute-fix.md](docs/playbooks/37c-header-logo-absolute-fix.md)

- Always checkpoint before visual or theme changes
- Never apply global CSS for section-specific fixes
- Header/logo fixes must be isolated to `header.php` only
