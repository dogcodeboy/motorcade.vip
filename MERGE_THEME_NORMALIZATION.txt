Motorcade Theme Vendoring Normalization Patch (2026-01-15)

Goal
- Normalize the vendored extracted theme directory path.
- Remove the accidental nested theme folder introduced during recovery.

This patch adds a canonical extracted theme directory at:
  ansible/files/themes/motorcade-trust/

After merging this patch into your repo, delete the accidental nested copy at:
  ansible/ansible/ansible/files/themes/motorcade-trust/

Then verify there is NO remaining ansible/ansible/ansible/ tree in the repo.

Notes
- This patch does not change any server state.
- Next session: add/revise a theme deploy playbook to install the theme from a single repo-managed source.
